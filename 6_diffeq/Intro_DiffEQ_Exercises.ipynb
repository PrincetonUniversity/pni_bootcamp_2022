Specifically, tasks studying *evidence accumulation* use differential equations to model behavior, an example of which is known as the *Poisson clicks task*. In this task, rats are presented with differing numbers of auditory clicks from left and right speakers in a behavioral chamber. Following the click train presentation, the animal must choose the side with the greater number of clicks. Below is a figure representation of the task (Brunton, Botvinick, & Brody, *Science*, 2013).\n",
